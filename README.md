# RISC-V
### Introduction To Our  5-Stage-Pipelined

I am a student in Software Engineering Department from UIT(Usman Institute Of Technology).\
My Interests are mostly in archetecture designs plus designing the core using the free and open source RISC-V ISA\
My work is mostly done in designing the core using the ISA of Risc V.

## First of all get started by Cloning this repository in your machine
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/monisj/Ghaznavi-5-Stage-Pipelined-Core.git
```

Create a .txt file and place the instruction(Hexa-Decimal) code simulated on ***Venus*** (RISC-V Simulator)\
Each instruction's hexadecimal code must be on seperate line as following. The following program consists of 9 instructions.
```
00200113
00300193
00218233
```
## Then perform the following step
```ruby
cd practice/Ghaznavi/src/main/scala/datapath
```
Open **InstructionMemory.scala** with this command. You can also manually go into the above path and open the file in your favorite text editor.
```ruby
open InstructionMemory.scala
```
Find the following line
``` python
loadMemoryFromFile(mem, "/Users/name/Desktop/yourfilenamehere.txt")
```
Change the .txt file path to match your file name that you created above to store your own program instructions.\
After setting up the InstructionMemory.scala file, go inside the ***Ghaznavi*** folder.
```ruby
cd practice/Ghaznavi
```
And enter
```ruby
sbt
```
When the terminal changes to this type
```ruby
sbt:Ghaznavi>
```
Enter this command
```ruby
sbt:Ghaznavi> test:runMain datapath.Launcher Top2
```
After you get success
```ruby
sbt:Ghaznavi> test:runMain datapath.Launcher Top2 --backend-name verilator
```
After success you will get a folder naming ***test_run_dir*** on root of your folder. Go to the examples folder inside.\
There you will find the folder named Top. Enter in it and you can find the Top.vcd file which you visualise on **gtkwave** to\
see your program running.
